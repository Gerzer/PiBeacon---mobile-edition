# PiBeacon - mobile edition
iOS client app for [PiBeacon](https://link.gerzer.net/pibeacon-github)

**This repository is currently outdated. Get the latest version from the [App Store](https://link.gerzer.net/pibeacon-mobile)**

## Requirements
~~Currently, PiBeacon - mobile edition requires iOS 11. Since iOS 11 is still in beta, this app is not yet available on the App Store. To use the app before iOS 11 comes out of beta, you must download the Xcode project and build it yourself using [Xcode 9](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or newer on macOS Sierra or newer. You will need to codesign it with your [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/). An [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) account isn't required, but you need to codesign with one in order to avoid having to resign and reinstall the app every 7 days.~~
